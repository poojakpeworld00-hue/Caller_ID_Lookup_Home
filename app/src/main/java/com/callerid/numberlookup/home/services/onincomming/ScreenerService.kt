/**
 * Screens incoming calls and silently rejects blocked numbers **before** they
 * ring. Active only while the app holds the CallScreening role (Android 10+,
 * granted from Settings). This is the proper way to block calls — unlike the
 * PHONE_STATE receiver's endCall() fallback, the call never rings through.
 *
 * It also raises the **caller-ID card** for calls we let through, rather than waiting
 * for the RINGING broadcast. This is the better trigger: it fires before the phone
 * rings, the number comes from [Call.Details] so it needs no READ_PHONE_STATE, and
 * holding the role is itself the background-start exemption the card needs.
 *
 * [CallStateReceiver] still raises the card on RINGING — that is the only path on
 * pre-Android-10 devices and whenever another app holds the role. The two overlap
 * whenever we *do* hold it, so [IdentFloatService.start] dedupes them.
 *
 * Note the card is only *raised* here; there is no call-end callback on a screening
 * service (the system unbinds right after [respondToCall]), so dismissal stays with
 * [CallStateReceiver] and [com.callerid.numberlookup.home.services.CallEndSentinel].
