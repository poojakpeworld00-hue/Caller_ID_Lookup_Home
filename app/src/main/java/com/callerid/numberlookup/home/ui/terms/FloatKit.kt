     * gates apply, either one closing it:
     *
     *  1. **We are the default launcher.** Holding `ROLE_HOME` is itself a
     *     background-activity-start exemption, so the post-call screen already
     *     starts directly through it (see IdentIdRegistry.holdsSystemDefaultRole)
     *     and asking for "display over other apps" on top of that buys nothing —
     *     so we don't ask. Checked live, because the role can be granted mid-session
     *     by the set-as-default onboarding step. The trade-off is deliberate: the
     *     ringing-time caller-ID card genuinely needs a WindowManager overlay, so on
     *     an unlocked phone a launcher user gets the full-screen card instead.
     *  2. **The IP-location "do not show" gate** — `Iscountry_Counter` +
     *     `CountryList_Counter_NShow` (see AdRelayActivity.funOnAdsLoad, which
     *     resolves the match once at splash into [AdsVault.isNShowLocation]). Put a
     *     country / region / city in that list and the permission disappears there;
     *     put the literal `all` in it and it disappears worldwide.
     *
     * Every surface that *asks* for the overlay honours this — the permission
     * sheet row, Home's Enable banner, the Terms step. It deliberately says
     * nothing about a permission the user has already granted: the caller-ID card
     * keeps working for them, because this gates the prompt, not the feature.
